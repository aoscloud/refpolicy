1) Reference Policy make targets:

General Make targets:

install-src		Install the policy sources into
			/etc/selinux/NAME/src/policy, where NAME is defined in
			the Makefile.  If not defined, the TYPE, as defined in
			the Makefile, is used.  The default NAME is refpolicy.
			A pre-existing source policy will be moved to
			/etc/selinux/NAME/src/policy.bak.

conf			Regenerate policy.xml, and update/create modules.conf
			and booleans.conf.  This should be done after adding
			or removing modules, or after running the bare target.
			If the configuration files exist, their settings will
			be preserved.  This must be ran on policy sources that
			are checked out from the CVS repository before they can
			be used.

clean			Delete all temporary files, compiled policies,
			and file_contexts.  Configuration files are left intact.

bare			Do the clean make target and also delete configuration
			files, web page documentation, and policy.xml.

html			Regenerate policy.xml and create web page documentation
			in the doc/html directory.

Make targets specific to modular (loadable modules) policies:

base			Compile and package the base module.  This is the
			default target for modular policies.

modules			Compile and package all Reference Policy modules
			configured to be built as loadable modules.

MODULENAME.pp		Compile and package the MODULENAME Reference Policy
			module.

all			Compile and package the base module and all Reference
			Policy modules configured to be built as loadable
			modules.

install			Compile, package, and install the base module and
			Reference Policy modules configured to be built as
			loadable modules.

load			Compile, package, and install the base module and
			Reference Policy modules configured to be built as
			loadable modules, then insert them into the module
			store.

validate		Validate if the configured modules can successfully
			link and expand.

install-headers		Install the policy headers into /usr/share/selinux/NAME.
			The headers are sufficient for building a policy
			module locally, without requiring the complete
			Reference Policy sources.  The build.conf settings
			for this policy configuration should be set before
			using this target.

build-interface-db	Build the policy interface database with
			'sepolgen-ifgen'.  This database is required for
			reference style policy generation by
			'audit2allow --reference'.

Make targets specific to monolithic policies:

policy			Compile a policy locally for development and testing.
			This is the default target for monolithic policies.

install			Compile and install the policy and file contexts.

load			Compile and install the policy and file contexts, then
			load the policy.

enableaudit		Remove all dontaudit rules from policy.conf.

relabel			Relabel the filesystem.

checklabels		Check the labels on the filesystem, and report when
			a file would be relabeled, but do not change its label.

restorelabels		Relabel the filesystem and report each file that is
			relabeled.


2) Reference Policy Build Options (build.conf)

TYPE			String.  Available options are standard, mls, and mcs.
			For a type enforcement only system, set standard.
			This optionally enables multi-level security (MLS) or
			multi-category security (MCS) features.  This option
			controls enable_mls, and enable_mcs policy blocks.

NAME			String (optional).  Sets the name of the policy; the
			NAME is used when installing files to e.g.,
			/etc/selinux/NAME and /usr/share/selinux/NAME.  If not
			set, the policy type (TYPE) is used.

DISTRO			String (optional).  Enable distribution-specific policy.
			Available options are redhat, gentoo, and debian.
			This option controls distro_redhat, distro_gentoo, and
			distro_debian build option policy blocks.

MONOLITHIC		Boolean.  If set, a monolithic policy is built,
			otherwise a modular policy is built.

DIRECT_INITRC		Boolean.  If set, sysadm will be allowed to directly
			run init scripts, instead of requiring the run_init
			tool.  This is a build option instead of a tunable since
			role transitions do not work in conditional policy.
			This option controls direct_sysadm_daemon policy
			blocks.

OUTPUT_POLICY		Integer.  Set the version of the policy created when
			building a monolithic policy.  This option has no effect
			on modular policy.

UNK_PERMS		String.  Set the kernel behavior for handling of
			permissions defined in the kernel but missing from the
			policy.  The permissions can either be allowed (allow),
			denied (deny), or the policy loading can be rejected
			(reject).

UBAC			Boolean.  If set, the SELinux user will be used
			additionally for approximate role separation.

SYSTEMD			Boolean.  If set, systemd will be assumed to be the init
			process provider.

MLS_SENS		Integer.  Set the number of sensitivities in the MLS
			policy.  Ignored on standard and MCS policies.

MLS_CATS		Integer.  Set the number of categories in the MLS
			policy.  Ignored on standard and MCS policies.

MCS_CATS		Integer.  Set the number of categories in the MCS
			policy.  Ignored on standard and MLS policies.

QUIET			Boolean.  If set, the build system will only display
			status messages and error messages.  This option has no
			effect on policy.

WERROR			Boolean.  If set, the build system will treat warnings
			as errors.  If any warnings are encountered, the build
			will fail.


3) Reference Policy Files and Directories
All directories relative to the root of the Reference Policy sources directory.

Makefile		General rules for building the policy.

Rules.modular		Makefile rules specific to building loadable module
			policies.

Rules.monolithic	Makefile rules specific to building monolithic policies.

build.conf		Options which influence the building of the policy,
			such as the policy type and distribution.

config/appconfig-*	Application configuration files for all configurations
			of the Reference Policy (targeted/strict with or without
			MLS or MCS).  These are used by SELinux-aware programs.

config/local.users	The file read by load policy for adding SELinux users
			to the policy on the fly.

doc/html/*		This contains the contents of the in-policy XML
			documentation, presented in web page form.

doc/policy.dtd		The doc/policy.xml file is validated against this DTD.

doc/policy.xml		This file is generated/updated by the conf and html make
			targets.  It contains the complete XML documentation
			included in the policy.

doc/templates/*		Templates used for documentation web pages.

policy/booleans.conf	This file is generated/updated by the conf make target.
			It contains the booleans in the policy, and their
			default values.  If tunables are implemented as
			booleans, tunables will also be included.  This file
			will be installed as the /etc/selinux/NAME/booleans
			file.

policy/constraints	This file defines additional constraints on permissions
			in the form of boolean expressions that must be
			satisfied in order for specified permissions to be
			granted.  These constraints are used to further refine
			the type enforcement rules and the role allow rules.
			Typically, these constraints are used to restrict
			changes in user identity or role to certain domains.

policy/global_booleans	This file defines all booleans that have a global scope,
			their default value, and documentation.

policy/global_tunables	This file defines all tunables that have a global scope,
			their default value, and documentation.

policy/flask/initial_sids  This file has declarations for each initial SID.

policy/flask/security_classes  This file has declarations for each security class.

policy/flask/access_vectors  This file defines the access vectors.  Common
			prefixes for access vectors may be defined at the
			beginning of the file.  After the common prefixes are
			defined, an access vector may be defined for each
			security class.

policy/mcs		The multi-category security (MCS) configuration.

policy/mls		The multi-level security (MLS) configuration.

policy/modules/*	Each directory represents a layer in Reference Policy
			all of the modules are contained in one of these layers.

policy/modules.conf	This file contains a listing of available modules, and
			how they will be used when building Reference Policy. To
			prevent a module from  being used, set the module to
			"off".  For monolithic policies, modules set to "base"
			and "module" will be included in the policy.  For
			modular policies, modules set to "base"	will be included
			in the base module; those set to "module" will be
			compiled as individual loadable	modules.

policy/support/*	Support macros.

policy/users		This file defines the users included in the policy.

support/*		Tools used in the build process.


4) Building policy modules using Reference Policy headers:

The system must first have the Reference Policy headers installed, typically
by the distribution.  Otherwise, the headers can be installed using the
install-headers target from the full Reference Policy sources.

To set up a directory to build a local module, one must simply place a .te
file in a directory.  A sample Makefile to use in the directory is the
Makefile.example in the doc directory.  This may be installed in
/usr/share/doc, under the directory for the distribution's policy.
Alternatively, the primary Makefile in the headers directory (typically
/usr/share/selinux/NAME/Makefile) can be called directly, using make's -f
option.

Larger projects can set up a structure of layers, just as in Reference
Policy, by creating policy/modules/LAYERNAME directories.  Each layer also
must have a metadata.xml file which is an XML file with a summary tag and
optional desc (long description) tag.  This should describe the purpose of
the layer.

Metadata.xml example:

<summary>ABC modules for the XYZ components.</summary>

Make targets for modules built from headers:

MODULENAME.pp		Compile and package the MODULENAME local module.

all			Compile and package the modules in the current
			directory.

load			Compile and package the modules in the current
			directory, then insert them into the module store.

refresh			Attempts to reinsert all modules that are currently
			in the module store from the local and system module
			packages.

xml			Build a policy.xml from the XML included with the
			base policy headers and any XML in the modules in
			the current directory.


## How to work with SELinux
### Introduction

Each process or resource (file, dir etc.) has a label (type) that describes what can be accessed.

SELinux considers subject-access-object rule set. On a Linux system, subjects are processes, and object is the resource
on which an action is applied.

Refpolicy contains the following file types:
1. **te** - (type enforcement) the file contains rules describing what the domain can do (labels of the subjects or objects). This file
does not say that this process can run another file, it just says that the process labeled A can read the file
labeled B.
2. **fc** - (file context) describes the security context (labels) on a file, directory, etc., which will be applied when the policy
is installed. By default, directories or files inherit the context of their parents, but the desired context could
be manually set using this file.
3. **if** - (interface file) creates the macros that other modules will use to gain access to the resources.

SELinux can run in one of three modes: **disabled**, **permissive**, or **enforcing**.
Using the **disabled** mode means that no rules from the SELinux policy are applied and system is not protected.
Therefore, the disabled mode is not recommended.
In the **permissive** mode, SELinux is active, the security policy is loaded, the file system is labeled and access
denial entries are logged. However, the policy is not enforced and thus no access is actually denied.
In the **enforced** mode, the security policy is applied. Each access that is not explicitly allowed by the policy
is denied.

To be able to check SELinux for possible access denials, set the **permissive** mode in the **meta-aos-vm**
for **refpolicy-aos** recipe to the **DEFAULT_ENFORCING** variable. This will make it possible to use SELinux,
but in logging mode.

To diagnose denials security policies, use the following command `journalctl | grep avc`, if the log contains
**avc: denied** that means it is an SELinux policy denial. This log will include a line like this:

```
AVC avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=1248 comm="dnsmasq" name="dev-log" dev="tmpfs" ino=20945
scontext=system_u:system_r:dnsmasq_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:syslogd_runtime_t:s0 tclass=sock_file permissive=0
```

- **scontext** - SELinux context of the process (source) that attempted the denied action
- **tcontext** - SELinux context of the object (target) the process attempted to access
- **comm** - name of the command that was used to access the target context name
- **tclass** - target object class
- **dev** - device on which the target resides
- **name** - name of the target
- can contained **path** -  path to the object (target) the process attempted to access.

The next step is to analyze the received log and find the corresponding **te** file by **scontext**, for example,
for **dnsmasq_t** there is a corresponding **dnsmasq.te** file and in this file a rule that allows
**scontext** to access **tcontext** has to be added.

### Recommended steps for editing refpolicy

To find the required **te** file where to add the rule, find a line declaring the **scontext** type
(label) as in example `type dnsmasq_t;`. Next, after the **Local policy comment**, add the desired rule.
Sometimes the rules are logically grouped, for example, there are rules for working with the `/etc` directory, etc.

**It is important** that before adding a rule, look for a possible macro for **tcontext** declared in a
file with the **if** extension. To find the necessary file **if**, first find the corresponding **te** file
in which the label will be declared and then take the **if** file with the same name. For example, the
`syslogd_runtime_t` label is declared in the `logging.te` file, then the macro should be looked for in the
`logging.if` file.

If some file or directory is marked with an incorrect label or `unlabeled_t`, then find the **te**
file where the label of interest is declared and take the file with the **fc** extension and declare the context for
the label of interest there. For example:

```
/usr/bin/aos_vis  --  gen_context(system_u:object_r:aos_exec_t,s0)
```

which means that the `aos_vis` file will be labeled `aos_exec_t`, this is an executable process.

To see what would be the correct or possible label in the `unlabeled_t`, run the `fixfiles -F -f relabel`
command or another command `restorecon`. After that the resource or process's will be labeled with proper context.

**It is important** If a new label needs to be created, it is important to create three files **te, fc, if** with the name
of the label that with which is created. The **te** file that declares (or in which the new label is declared) should not
be empty whereas **fc**, **if** files can be empty.

Sometimes, logs may contain denials security policies that are not very critical, for example, reading
file attribute or read a file that may not affect the system, or when login into the system being created
policies to denial write to the system log:

```
avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=1034 comm="login" name="dev-log" dev="tmpfs" ino=20945
scontext=system_u:system_r:local_login_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
tcontext=system_u:object_r:syslogd_runtime_t:s0 tclass=sock_file permissive=0
```

For these denials **rules may not be added** to the refpolicy if it is not necessary.

After the corresponding security policy is added, it is necessary to build the refpolicy again through yocto.

**It is important** not to add a rule to the `unlabled_t` label, unless the `scontext` is one of the labeling utilities
like `fixfiles`. In this case, find the reason why this resource or process was not marked up and add the
appropriate label through the `fc` file or in another way.
